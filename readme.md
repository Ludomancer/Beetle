This project is based on Beetle Game. http://www.ru.ac.za/media/rhodesuniversity/content/sanc/documents/SANC%20Beetle%20game%20instructions.pdf

# Development Mode
- It can be enabled by toggle in game at upper left corner.
- Enabling it bypasses animations and makes sure any dice rolled would result in a valid number. Some animations and systems may not work as expected, therefore the actual tests should be done with Development Mode disabled.
